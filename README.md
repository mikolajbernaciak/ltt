## Using the site

Firstly, it's meant to run on a computer, with a s screen at least 1280px in width. Appologies but no mobile styling at the moment.

Search requires location name to be types in full e.g. southampton.

See [https://github.com/mikolajbernaciak/ltt/blob/main/locations.json](locations.json) file for possible options.

Filtering by 'Care required' will is only implemented for 'Residential care'
